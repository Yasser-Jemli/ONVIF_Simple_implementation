SO far 

Here's a simple C implementation of an ONVIF device discovery service that runs as a command-line tool. This program:

    Sends a WS-Discovery probe request using UDP multicast
    Receives responses from ONVIF devices
    Extracts the device's IP address and service address
    Stores the discovered devices in a list


    compile the code main.c with gcc onvif_discovery.c -o onvif_discovery -lpthread -ltinyxml2
    



use the Command to verifiy if you have a respoanse from the emulator or not --> curl --silent --max-time 5 http://192.168.97.14:10000/onvif/device_service
